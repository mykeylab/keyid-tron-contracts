# Overview  
MYKEY is a decentralized smart wallet, which means MYKEY account is a smart contract, rather than an EOA address. This highly improves security and usability.  
MYKEY has 3 main characteristics:  
- **Separated permissions**. Various action permissions(like transferring asset, account management, etc.) are owned by separated multiple keys.  
- **Recoverable account**. All keys of MYKEY account are replaceable. In extreme cases when all keys are lost, one can still recover his/her account with the assist of emergency contacts.  
- **Meta-transaction**. MYKEY users don't need to care about gas price or gas limit. All transactions are delivered by "postman" accounts with meta-transaction mechanism.
